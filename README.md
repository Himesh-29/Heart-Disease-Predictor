# Heart-Disease-Predictor

In this repository, I have created a machine learning model which will detect that whether a person has heart disease or not depending upon certain criteri and compared various training algorithms get the best score.
<p>The algorithms that I have used are: <b>KNeighborsClassifier</b>, <b>Support Vector Machine</b>, <b>GuassianNB</b>, <b>Bayesian Ridge Classification</b>, <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>Random forest classifier</b>
<p>For demo I have given the dataset which I used in my model to train (downloaded from kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction">Heart Failure
Prediction Dataset</a>). But you can use any dataset that you like
</p>
Just clone this repository using <code>https://github.com/Himesh-29/Heart-Disease-Predictor.git</code>, open jupter notebook and just run all the cells.

### Python package needed:
<ul>
  <li>Sklearn (<b>To install, write</b> <code>pip install sklearn</code>)</li>
  <li>Pandas (<b>To install, write</b> <code>pip install pandas</code>)</li>
  <li>Numpy (<b>To install, write</b> <code>pip install numpy</code>)</li>
</ul>
